# What Good Looks Like - private consulting business #buildinpublic 

Welcome. üëã  
I'm about to do something really uncomfortable.  
I'm going to try private consulting, content marketing, more writing, and do it all in public.  
It's scary af but I suspect that the adventure lies in the discomfort.

## What is this?

This is a public repo detailing the steps and my progress to starting a side hustle with private consulting. The steps are inspired by a [LinkedIn Post by Justin Welsh in early 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinwelsh_how-to-build-a-1300month-side-business-activity-7037047400045117440-J_W-/). It's public for two main reasons:

* I like the principles and benefits of the #buildinpublic movement, and
* I need less comfort in my life. This is scary AF!

The goal here is to create a new income stream for myself by utilising skills and knowledge I already have: consulting about software engineering. 

## What is 'What Good Looks Like'?

This is a phrase I've heard more in recent years as I speak to more experienced engineers. It's the basis of my marketing angle, a hook for my content, and my mission with the consulting. I want to help software teams and leaders understand what good looks like. Then I want to take them on the journey to get there.

If you already know what good looks like, or you want to, and you need help with your team/project asap then let's book a time to chat right fucken now! [DM me on twitter](https://twitter.com/mattkocaj)
