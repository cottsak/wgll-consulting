# What Good Looks Like - private consulting business #buildinpublic 

Welcome. 👋  
I'm about to do something really uncomfortable.  
I'm going to try private consulting, content marketing, more writing, and do it all in public.  
It's scary af but I suspect that the adventure lies in the discomfort.

Stand by while I [copy these steps from Justin Welsh](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinwelsh_how-to-build-a-1300month-side-business-activity-7037047400045117440-J_W-/) into this repo and come along for the ride as I smash all sorts of shit I've never done before. 💪
